## Hi there 👋

My name is Jaroslav, and I’ve been programming my entire life. When I was 10 years old, I started writing my first programs for microcontrollers using assembler and C++. At that time, I relied on paper books to study programming — something weird these days! Later, I discovered higher-level languages and frameworks like Pascal, Delphi, and the .NET Framework. After purchasing my first MacBook and winning an iPod Touch in a photo contest, I began developing mobile apps for iOS using Objective-C.

During my student years, I spent four months working in the 🇺🇸 U.S. as a lifeguard. One of my achievements was saving the lives of four children during the season.
Here’s the edited version:

I program for both money and fun. I have a bunch of pet projects and always enjoy learning something new, so I can proudly say that I’m a nerd. I hope my open-source projects will help you in some way! Here’s a little more about me:

- 🏗️ I'm a Full-Stack developer now because I love developing projects entirely and understanding how they work at each level.
- 🤓 In my free time, I do a lot of DIY projects with electronics and my 3D printer. I dream of fully diving into robotics one day 🤖
- 📝 I have [my blog](https://blog.husky-dev.me/en/)
- 🛠️ For a list of my projects, [check out my website](https://husky-dev.me/projects/).
- 📚 Book lover
- 🏋️‍♂️ CrossFit
- 🏍️ Riding a Honda Hornet CB600F.
- 🏔️ I've hiked to the 🇳🇵Everest Base Camp, reached the peak of 🇹🇿 Kilimanjaro, and climbed 🇺🇦 Hoverla.
- 🛫 At non-war time, I love to travel:<br/>🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇸🇬 🇳🇿 🇯🇵 🇹🇿 🇳🇦 🇳🇵 🇱🇰 🇵🇪 🇵🇱 🇩🇪 🇮🇹 🇦🇹 🇵🇹 🇬🇷 🇬🇪
