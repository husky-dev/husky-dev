## Hi there 👋

I'm Jaroslav! I've been a **Software Engineer** for more than 15 years now. When I'm not working, I love contributing to open-source projects. You'll see a bunch of random stuff on my profile – they're all things I've created at some point to simplify my life or when I'm messing around with new technologies. Who knows, they might just come in handy for you too!

- 🏗️ I'm into Full-Stack development because I love crafting complete products for end users.
- 🤓 I've got a bunch of electronics and a 3D Printer. In my free time, I dive into DIY projects. Dreaming of starting my own robotics company someday 🤖
